<!--				Lenny's Story   			-->
<!--====================================================================-->
<B><font style="font-size:14pt;">
It is with great sadness and heavy heart that we share the news of the sudden death of Lenny Dower. &nbsp; He passed away Sunday (17 Nov 02) afternoon.

<P>
The viewing will be Wednesday, November 20th from 6pm-8pm at
<BR> David Jarrett Funeral Home
<BR> 2nd & Pine Sts.
<BR> Mahanoy City, PA 17948

<P>
The memorial service is scheduled for 11am on Thursday.

<P>
If you wish to send condolences to his family, please do so either to this address:
<BR> Adrienne Mills-Dower
<BR> c/o Samantha Guers
<BR> 1360 Stag Dr.
<BR> Lake Wynonah, Auburn, PA 17922

<P> Or

<P>Post a message through the "V8 H-Body Talk" bulletin board <A HREF="http://pub52.ezboard.com/fv8hbodytalkfrm1" TARGET="_top">General Discussion forum</A>. &nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:vegadad@aol.com" TARGET="_top">John (vegadad)</A>(Thank you John), will forward them on to Lenny's wife.

<P>
For those who wish to make a donation to his family rather than send flowers, the Lenny Dower fund will remain open with all the funds going directly to his family. &nbsp; It need not be a large donation (although those will be accepted) but a little from many of us could go a long way to help defer the family's expenses. &nbsp;  Even if you can't give financially, Lenny's family asks that you remember him in prayer. &nbsp; Also, pray for the strength of his family in this difficult time.

<P>
Many of the members of the H-Body enthusiast community have shown their care & concern for Lenny and his family since he suffered a massive brain hemorrhage in January and throughout what seemed to be a gradual but remarkable recovery period over the course of these past 10 months.

<P>
Following an emergency surgery for the brain hemorrhage in January, he fell into a coma and was put on life support for a month. &nbsp;  He stayed in the coma until early April when he had begun to come around and slowly become more aware. &nbsp;  More recently Lenny had reached a point where he was beginning to be able to communicate with his family again. &nbsp; This sudden loss has come as shock to us all. &nbsp; The H-Body community has lost a very talented man. &nbsp; We know that many of you like ourselves have followed the updates of his condition and watched, hoped and prayed as Lenny fought his way back. &nbsp; We had all hoped that the day would come that he would be able to get back to his favorite hobby. &nbsp; Our thoughts and prayers are with Lenny's family in this difficult time.

<P>
This page will stay up as a memorial to Lenny and his love for the H-Body. &nbsp; The images you see on this page are some of Lenny's H-Body projects. &nbsp;  As you can see, he was very talented. &nbsp;  He will be truly missed. &nbsp; From us here at v8monza.com and from the rest of the H-Body community, we send our deepest sympathies most sincere condolences to Lenny's family.

<P>
As most of you know, Lenny had a blood disease that was the ultimate cause of the hemorrhage that put him in a Coma back in January, and ended up with his death last week. That disease is called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PNH for short. The following link provides more information on this disease.  <A HREF="http://www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/diseases2/pnh.htm" TARGET="_top">The Doctor's Doctor PNH information</A>

<P>
I never personally met either Lenny or Adrienne, but I feel like I know them both. I have been following Adriennes's updates on Lenny's condition via email from John B. (vegadad), right up until the end last week. Lenny and Adrienne were both in my daily prayers, as well as on the prayer list at my church. Adrienne, please know that you are still in my prayers. I pray that God will keep you strong as you begin to put your life back in order. I kept silent on the board until now because I didn’t know what to say or what to do, so I waited. I waited for John to get an answer from Adrienne about the name of Lenny’s disease. I searched the web and found several links that deal with PNH research, as well as a memorial page to another victim of this devastating disease. There are many, many more links to other pages about this disease than I have posted here.

<P>
I will be sending out a donation to the Deb Valcik PNH Research Fund in memory of Lenny on Friday.  Maybe with more research into this disease new and better treatments can be developed, maybe even a cure.  I would like to make a friendly challenge to all other HBOA members to also make donations in Lenny's memory as well.  Please don't publicize any dollar amounts, just quick <A HREF="http://pub52.ezboard.com/fv8hbodytalkfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1032.topic" TARGET="_top">post</A> to say "I sent mine, too".  I know many of you already sent money directly to Adrienne to help cover expenses, and I'm sure she appreciated it. I know I would.
<P>
Donations may be sent to the following address:
<P>
The Deb Valcik PNH Research Fund

<BR><A HREF="http://www.aamds.org/" TARGET="_top">Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation (AA&MDSIF)</A>
<BR>PO Box 613
<BR>Annapolis, Maryland 21404-0613
<P>
Checks can be made out to AA&MDSIF
<P>
BE SURE to indicate that the donation goes to the Deb Valcik PNH Research Fund.
<P>
100% of the money donated not only goes to the PNH research fund, but 100% of the money is spent on research...the AA&MDSIF does not take a single penny out for any type of administrative or management costs, every penny goes to the doctor for research.
<P>
Thanks for listening...
<BR>Dave
