<BR><u><b>CAUTION!</b></u>
</CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Horsepower can be <b>DANGEROUS</b> and requires extreme <b>CAUTION</b> when in use.&nbsp;  The suspension components and safety equipment should be regularly inspected so as to prevent sudden failure.&nbsp;  Sudden failure of suspension components and safety equipment could result in death and or serious injury to people or property.</u>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having said that, getting your H-Body car or Vega to perform like a real screamer is not as difficult nor as expensive as you might think.&nbsp;  Thanks to the low weight and compact size, a decently tuned stock engine can run circles around just about anything comparatively equipped.&nbsp;  Put some more ponies into it through careful selection of parts and attention to detail will be rewarded with more horsepower than you can handle.&nbsp;  Also, there are a lot of myths and opinions out there about how to go about it.&nbsp;  These are my tested and true opinions and what I've learned.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This FAQ is a compilation of my experiences as well as other's with the V8 Chevy Monza, Vega and other H-Bodies.&nbsp;  There are some sections that have no information in them yet, but I'm always adding to it, so if you don't see what you're looking for check back regularly or <A HREF="mailto:%62%6F%62%67%75%6D%6D%40%76%38%6D%6F%6E%7A%61%2E%63%6F%6D">e-mail me</A>.&nbsp;  Also, read this information the same as any information you find on the internet and make your own decisions about what you read.&nbsp;  If you find errors, have any suggestions, personal experiences, or information you think would be useful here, please <A HREF="mailto:%62%6F%62%67%75%6D%6D%40%76%38%6D%6F%6E%7A%61%2E%63%6F%6D">e-mail me</A>.&nbsp;  I make no attempts to mislead you, I only know what worked for me and I won't be liable for any damage to equipment, injury to persons, errors in judgement, or depletion of your finances.&nbsp;  Hey, I gotta protect myself.

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">I've had a lot of experience in this
        area, so I've a lot to say about it. The selection of
        your intake manifold is like the cam, pick one suited to
        your needs.&nbsp;  Sure the bigger one will look killer on your
        engine, but it'll also foul your sparkplugs quicker and
        run like crap in the winter months.&nbsp;  Take my advice, if
        you use the car for daily driving, a dual-plane intake
        manifold is what you want.&nbsp;  </FONT><B>I prefer Holley
        carbs since they are easier on the wallet and parts are
        easy to find when adjustments and custom tailoring are
        required</B>.&nbsp;  <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">Again, the choice is
        yours, make it and live with it.</FONT>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;"><B>Your next question is what size
        intake and what size carburetor?</B> I was once told
        by a parts counter man "that carburetors way too big,
        your car'll never run right." He was right in the
        sense that if I used it "as is" right out of
        the box, it was too big.&nbsp;  But I planned to rejet the carb,
        and his suggestions, although well meaning, fell on deaf
        ears.&nbsp;  I said to him "<B>remember the '69 Z28
        302 with that huge crossram intake and twin 650 cfm
        carbs,</B>" he didn't give me anymore advice on
        carburetors.&nbsp;  If performance is your goal, a huge
        dual-plane intake can be used for street use, but to use
        a large runner intake you need a small carb.&nbsp;  Almost the
        same gains can be experienced using a small runner
        intake.&nbsp;  "What," you say, "how is that
        possible?" It's simpler than you think, <B>it's
        all a matter of fluid dynamics</B>.&nbsp;  That doesn't
        sound simple I know, but here's the explanation.&nbsp;  The
        air-fuel mixture starts at the carburetor, and velocity
        is what makes the fuel atomize with the air in the
        carburetor.&nbsp;  <B>Velocity is the key</B>,
        atomizing the mixture makes it burn more completely.&nbsp;  Now
        if that mixture has to take a sudden turn the fuel may
        separate from the air and puddle causing a lean condition
        in the engine.&nbsp;  The transition of the fuel from the
        carburetor is critical here.&nbsp;  </FONT>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">When using a <B>small carburetor
        combined with a small intake</B>, the mixture exits
        the carb at a high velocity and has to make a sudden turn
        into the intake manifold's runner with a high probability
        of fuel separation resulting in fuel droplet formation.
        These droplets do not burn efficiently.&nbsp;  One way to
        correct this would be to place an open plenum carburetor
        spacer between the carb and intake.&nbsp;  This would allow the
        mixture to momentarily slow down to take the turn into
        the intake runner where it will accelerate into the
        engine's cylinder.&nbsp;  The only possible problem there can be
        with this solution is hood clearance, so choose your
        spacer accordingly.</FONT>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">When using a <B>large carburetor
        with a large intake manifold</B>, fuel atomization
        is all but impossible at low to mid-range RPMs.&nbsp;  Again,
        this mixture will not burn efficiently.&nbsp;  One way to
        correct this would be to place a restricted plenum
        carburetor spacer between the carb and intake.&nbsp;  Make sure
        the carburetor throttle blades don't contact the spacer
        or damage to the carburetor will occur.&nbsp;  This would allow
        the mixture to momentarily speed up allowing the mixture
        to atomize before entering the intake runner where it
        will continue towards the engine's cylinder.&nbsp;  The
        carb will require rejetting so count on doing it for the
        best performance gains or your money will be wasted.&nbsp;  <FONT
        SIZE="3">The only possible problem there can be with this
        solution is hood clearance, so choose your spacer
        accordingly.</FONT>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">When using a <B>small carburetor
        with a large intake</B> the mixture enters the
        intake atomized and slows to turn into the intake runner
        while still remaining somewhat atomized.&nbsp;  Using a <B>large
        carburetor on a small intake</B> will result in not
        so good atomization.&nbsp;  Rejetting the carb with smaller jets
        helps and the small runners of the intake can actually
        improve the atomization process enabling the engine to
        run somewhat better than expected.</FONT>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">Changing the cam and lifters will
        tailor the performance of the engine to your needs.
        Choose wisely since this change will determine the
        streetability and temperament of your machine.&nbsp; If
        you're using a relatively stock engine, you might opt for
        an RV cam.&nbsp;  An RV cam will not lope and will increase
        performance without sacrificing the engine's compression.
        Long duration cams kill low compression engine
        performance.&nbsp;  If you are planning on a long duration cam,
        you'll want higher compression pistons or your lower RPM
        performance will be disastrous.&nbsp;  Tell your cam specialist
        your vehicle's weight, rear gear ratio, tire size,
        engine's compression ratio, and primary purpose of the
        vehicle and take their advice.&nbsp;  Obviously if you drive the
        vehicle to work daily, you don't need a cam that's for 9
        second blasts at the track.&nbsp;  But hey, I could be wrong, I
        myself have run cams on the street that were labeled
        "<B>Not For Highway Use</B>".&nbsp;  The
        bottom line is you've been warned, once you've made your
        choice you're stuck with it.</FONT>

    ALIGN=center BORDER=0 WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=224>
    <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">You can use the same electric fuel pump
    so long as you don't plan on RPMs over 4000, rapid
    acceleration, or a bigger carburetor.&nbsp; If you do,
    the carb will run out of gas resulting in the engines
    demise due to a leaning out condition causing
    pre-ignition and piston damage.&nbsp; I know this because
    I made that mistake 10 years ago and had to install a new
    piston.</FONT>
    <BR><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:14pt;"><B>Aftermarket Fuel Pumps</B></FONT>
    <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">If you do plan on higher RPMs, or a bigger carburetor, I     would suggest an aftermarket elec. pump like a Holley with a pressure regulator.&nbsp;  When using         an aftermarket fuel pump, the factory pump must be removed from the fuel tank or it will     restrict the fuel flow and defeat the purpose of the new one.&nbsp;  Once removed, you'll need to     extend the length of the pickup in the tank since removal of the pump shortened it.&nbsp;  Don't     forget to reinstall the filter sock on the end to prevent unwanted trash from entering the     fuel line.&nbsp;  I even added a Carter Z/28 mechanical pump for added measure.&nbsp;  Adding the     mechanical pump required notching the front of the right K-brace (the V8 car brace going     from under the front of the oil pan to the front right sway bar bushing mount     location).</FONT>

        <BR><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:14pt;"><B>Catalytic Converters</B></FONT>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">Catalytic converters used to be heavy, performance
        robbing, ugly boat anchors.&nbsp;  Performance versions exist
        that do the job, weigh less, and increase performance
        over the factory pieces.&nbsp;  The only downside to this is
        they still cost an arm and a leg.</font>
        <BR><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:14pt;"><B>Emissions Hoses</B></FONT>
        <BR>&nbsp; <FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">Emissions hoses are ugly, hard to work around and can
        make troubleshooting a nightmare, but they are the law
        and <B>can be tweaked to help performance</B>.
        Also, removing emissions components from vehicles is
        looked down upon by the emissions testers so check your
        state laws before doing it.&nbsp;  Emissions controls are not as
        bad on engine performance as most people think.&nbsp;
        Having said that, they usually just require upgrading to
        higher flowing components to benefit a really souped-up
        engine.&nbsp; However, this usually means removing the
        existing components and redesigning and building a system
        that will work with the new horsepower and torque ratings
        of the engine.&nbsp; There are examples of this
        technology at your local race track actually being used
        to the benefit of racing.&nbsp;  Don't believe me, look at the
        top fuel engines running crankcase evacuation systems.
        These systems are used to reduce crankcase pressures and
        extend gasket life as well as performance gains.&nbsp;  The less
        pressure in the crankcase, the easier it is for the
        piston to go down the cylinder and thus more power to the
        wheels.&nbsp;  As for the ugly hoses running everywhere, try
        using steel braided lines or hose covers with anodized
        fittings at the ends.&nbsp;  Next, route them neatly using nylon
        ties and looms, this will make working around them much
        easier.&nbsp;  The result will be an awesome looking engine, and
        with all those braided lines you're sure to be accused of
        sneaking nitrous in there somewhere.&nbsp;  That will make your
        competition think twice before challenging you. ;-)
