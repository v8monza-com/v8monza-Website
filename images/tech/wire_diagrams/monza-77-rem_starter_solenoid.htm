<!--?G!!TEXTB-->A remote starter solenoid is a worthwhile addition to any Chevy-powered car.  The General messed up big-time when he mounted the solenoid directly on the starter which keeps very close company with the VERY hot passenger-side headers.  This modification is also very desirable in cars with their batteries mounted in the trunk.<P>
The illustration below is a schematic diagram for such an installation.  For clarity's sake, I only drew the pertinent wires and components.<P>
While it may look a little complicated, only the wires that were originally connected directly to the solenoid have been lengthened to reach the remote solenoid in the trunk.  These are the three uppermost wires in the diagram.  The 12-gauge purple wire and the 10-gauge red wire were originally connected to the S and B terminals of the solenoid respectively.  The black wire on top was originally a 4-gauge wire connected to the positive terminal of the battery.  I did not specify a gauge in the drawing.  In my Camaro, I used 00-gauge welding cable.  I will probably use the same in the Monzter.  The bigger, the better.<P>
Any wire that passes through a sheet metal panel such as the firewall should be protected by a rubber grommet to prevent chafing.  There are firewall carry-through isolator/connectors available that allow you to fasten larger, heavier cables to either side of the firewall with nuts.  This is probably a good idea.  However, this is not necessary for smaller gauge wires like the purple and red ones.  Rubber grommets will protect these sufficiently.<P>
You will notice a shunt that connects the B and S terminals on the stock solenoid.  The store bought kits use a piece of copper.  You can easily fabricate your own shunt from a short length of 10-gauge wire and a couple of properly sized ring terminals.<P>
The most important component, of course, is the Ford starter solenoid.  This unit has a large terminal on each side and two small terminals marked S and I in the middle.  The solenoid is grounded through the mounting bracket.  Make sure there is good contact between it and the part of the trunk to which you bolt it.<P>
It does not matter which of the large side terminals is connected to the battery or to the starter.  Just keep the wiring as neat as possible.<P>
The S terminal is, quite logically, the switch terminal.  Apply 12 volts to it and the circuit between the two large terminals will close.<P>
The I terminal is, again logically, the ignition terminal.  It is not used in this installation.  In older Ford cars with points-type ignition systems, this terminal provided 12 volts to the coil while starting--bypassing the resistor or resistor wire to momentarily increase ignition voltage.<P>
However, this terminal may be utilized in cars with aftermarket oil pressure switches with only two terminals.  Tap the blue wire that goes to the fuel pump and run the other end to the I terminal in order to energize the electric fuel pump during starting.  Once the engine starts and oil pressure is available, the pump will be energized through the factory circuit.<P><!--?G!!TEXTE-->

<!--?G!!TEXTB-->While this is a relatively simple circuit, PLEASE study the diagram VERY carefully before cutting, splicing, connecting, soldering, or anything.  Remember Murphy's Law at all times.  Remember also that any modification you do to your car is done at your own risk.  If you are in doubt of your own capabilities, get a qualified automotive electrician to do it or help you do it.<P>
Have fun!  Good luck!<P><!--?G!!TEXTE-->
