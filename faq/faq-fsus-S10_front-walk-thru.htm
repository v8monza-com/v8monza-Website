&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well it took me forever, but I've finally made this
upgrade.&nbsp; To be honest, it was easy.&nbsp; It took me a little longer than
it should take most because I did lots of research, took measurements, and I
stopped and staged photo shoots along the way so I could post this comprehensive
guide.&nbsp; I used a <U>balljoint adapter kit</U> that I devloped and had made locally. 

&nbsp; <B>If anyone would like one of my kits, <A HREF="mailto:%62%6F%62%67%75%6D%6D%40%76%38%6D%6F%6E%7A%61%2E%63%6F%6D">e-mail me</A>. &nbsp; You'll get a Balljoint Adapter Kit, a basic instruction package, and this web address where you can always come back for more information and e-mail me any questions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a very straightforward modification and everything went as
planned. &nbsp; A few modifications had to be made that I will explain later.&nbsp; So, lets get
started.&nbsp; -- <i>Bob Gumm</i></FONT></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><b><i><u>WHY?</u></i></b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">&nbsp; The H-Body cars </FONT><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:10pt;"><I><EM>(Chevrolet Monza/Spyder/Mirage
and Vega, Oldsmobile Starfire/Firenza, Buick Skyhawk/Roadhawk/Nighthawk, Pontiac
Astre, Sunbird/Formula)</I></EM></I></FONT><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;"> are all
capable of being modified to accept the <A href="5LugList.htm" TARGET="Newwindow">G-Body or Chevy S10/S15/Blazer 5-lug
front suspension parts</A>.&nbsp; The performance gains are better braking (due to larger
modern vented rotors, calipers, and pads), better handling (due to a larger
selection of rims and tires), and better acceleration (due to lower rolling
resistance of taller tires).&nbsp; Also, since the 5-lug swap opens the way to a
larger selection of rims and tires, you'll be able to set your H-Body apart from
the rest with many more options available to you. &nbsp; <B>There are several ways to upgrade your front suspension using the spindles and rotor/caliper assemblies from 79-88 Monte Carlo/Malibu/Century/Regal/Cutlass/Grand Prix/Lemans/S10/S10 Blazer or GMC Sprint <A href="5LugList.htm" TARGET="Newwindow">(see list)</A>. &nbsp; (1.) &nbsp; Using special parts called balljoint adapter bushings with Monza upper and lower balljoints. &nbsp; (2.) &nbsp; Using adapters on the upper balljoints and modifying the lower control arms to accept the lower S10 balljoints. &nbsp; (3.) &nbsp; Using adapters on the lower balljoints and modifying the upper control arms to accept the upper S10 balljoints. &nbsp; (4.) &nbsp; Modifying the upper and lower control arms to accept the S10 balljoints. &nbsp; NOTE: when using the adapters, you must use 1975 or later lower balljoints as the 1974 and earlier lower balljoints are too small. &nbsp; All H-Body upper balljoints are the same size. &nbsp; Late model balljoints are still available at your local parts store.</B></FONT></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;"><b><u>Alternatives</u></b></FONT></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">&nbsp;  If you want to convert an H-Body to 5-lug front suspension,
there are expensive aftermarket kits available (such as Baer or Wilwood) but replacement parts are not as easily found as are factory parts.&nbsp; Most kits are advertised to fit the Chevy Vega, so look for those.&nbsp; Some folks have used dropped spindles made for the G-Bodied cars in conjunction with the swap mentioned here.&nbsp; Although expensive, this is a good idea since the 5-lug rim and tire combination you'll be installing will probably be taller than the old 13&quot; rims and tires you removed anyway, resulting a higher front suspension.&nbsp; So the dropped spindles would probably put you close to where you were before. &nbsp; Also, some folks still modify new H-Body front rotors to 5-lug by welding the existing holes and drilling and installing studs in the 5-lug pattern. &nbsp; However, this places the studs very close to the edge of the "hat" of the rotor, in my and many others opinion this is unsafe for performance purposes.  Besides, you are still stuck with the older brakes which are unsuitable for any performance purposes.

<!--
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Popular Hotrodding's 1979 issue (don't know what month) wrote on the subject in an article titled "Five Lug Hubs for V-8 Vegas" stating <EM><I>"The easy way (it seems) to cure this situation is just to have your front hubs drilled for five lugs. &nbsp; We did just that on our Vega. &nbsp; The hubs were drilled and tapped for studs to use the five-lug pattern. &nbsp; It works, but the diameter of the hub is just barely wide enough to accommodate the new 4 & 1/4-inch bolt circle. &nbsp; Not the hot setup for a car intended for high-performance use."
-->
</EM></I></FONT>

<P>
NOTE: &nbsp; We were contacted by Dave Quarterman himself, president of Dave's Vega Village who told us

<UL>	<EM><I>"For the record, we do not weld anything. &nbsp; The original four studs are pressed out. &nbsp; We then put a tap in the holes and thread them. &nbsp; After that, we insert a cast iron pipe plug with 680 Locktite. &nbsp; Finally, we lathe the surface. &nbsp; Welding is not a part of this procedure, and never has been. &nbsp; And our products are safe..."</EM></I></UL>

<P>
So we were misinformed, evidently Dave's Vega Village does not weld their rotors in any way. &nbsp; According to Dave himself, Dave's Vega Village makes a 5-lug modification that is safe. &nbsp; We were also incorrect about the Don Hardy rotors. &nbsp; Don Hardy used to sell a custom redesigned rotor that was greatly improved with a wider hub diameter and the 5-lug pattern was cast in the design. &nbsp; However, Don Hardy no longer sells 5-lug rotors for the H-Body and at this time we are unsure if anyone but Dave's Vega Village does.

<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><b><i><u>SAFETY FIRST!</u></i></b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">&nbsp; Keep
in mind that front suspensions have very strong front springs that can easily
kill if not properly restrained (usually the larger the engine, the stronger the
springs and the more dangerous).&nbsp; Take precautions to ensure that the
springs are compressed and restrained using a quality coil-spring
compressor and/or chain.&nbsp; Again, keep in mind if the spring breaks free it can cause
serious injury and/or death.&nbsp; If you don't plan on completely overhauling
the front suspension, <u>inspect the front suspension before the swap to make sure it is in good shape</u>,
that way you can replace all of the worn components during the swap.</FONT></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><b><i><u>CONCERNS...?</u></i></b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 0"><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">&nbsp; </FONT><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">Concerns about suspension geometry can be
settled by looking at the parts to be used.&nbsp; Below is a picture of my
original 4-lug components compared to the S10 parts I installed.&nbsp; Notice
that the difference of the outside dimensions from the top of the upper balljoint boss to the
bottom of the lower balljoint boss is only 1/16&quot; and the difference in the
length of the tie-rod arm is only 1/2&quot;.&nbsp; <b>I prefer the
S10/S15/Blazer parts since the lug-nuts/studs are larger (stronger) </b>and the
steering knuckle on the spindle is only 1/2&quot; longer than the stock Monza
piece whereas the G-Body part is a full inch longer.&nbsp; <b>Keep in mind that
the S10 studs are metric and will require size 12X1.5 lug nuts.</b>&nbsp; For
you racers, you will want to get longer lug studs so they will protrude past
your open lug nuts (length depends on wheel thickness).

<FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">
As you can see, the S10 spindle (lower right) is beefier than the H-Body piece.
<BR>
The distance between balljoints is less on the S10 part, but the tie rod arm is 1/2" longer.

        is a challenge, but one easily tackled with some ingenuity.&nbsp; As can
        be seen here, the brake hose to brake line bracket has keyways in
        it.&nbsp; As luck would have it, the keyway is just the opposite of what
        it needs to be and swapping the brackets won't solve the problem as they are both keyed the same.&nbsp;
        The top-left picture shows the side that the brake hose must mate to
        (shown mated in the top-right picture).&nbsp; The lower-left picture
        shows the backside of the bracket with the factory Monza brake hose
        inserted into the keyed hole.&nbsp; The Monza brake hose is too short to
        reach the S10 brake caliper requiring a set of new 15&quot; long hoses
        with an end shaped like the bottom-right image.&nbsp; I used a pair of <b>Brakeware<font FACE="Symbol">â</font>
        P/N 88624</b> hoses (for 1976 Chevy Nova) purchased from AutoZone for just $15.00 each.</FONT></li>

	brake bias will be incorrect resulting in malfunctioning brakes.&nbsp; <b>Tip - the <u>G-Body reservoir will not work	</u> because it is tilted forward (see picture - lower right).</b>&nbsp; I learned this the hard way, and it was a $15 lesson.&nbsp; Luckily the reservoir snaps in and out with some determination.&nbsp; So get an S10/S15/Blazer master cylinder (see picture - upper right) with 	it's reservoir or purchase the reservoir separately.&nbsp; Otherwise, you'll ruin the paint when the brake fluid 	spills out during servicing and you'll never get it <U>FULL</U> again.</FONT></li>
