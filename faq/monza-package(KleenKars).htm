<H1>...and along came a spyder</H1>
<HR><IMG SRC="spy1.jpg" ALT="[IMAGE]" >
<BR>
<P>These are the emblems that would have come on the side fenders of all 1976 monza spyders and any spyder thereafter 77-79 when the Z02(spyder graphics) was deleted and only Z01 (suspension upgrade)was ordered. Boy are they hard to find..if you see these in a salvage yard ,grab em!! </P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><P> <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>FOR 1976<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>...</B>2,339 hatchbacks AND coupe models had these emblems.No graphic package was available yet.They were probably mostly all V8 cars.Though 140ci 4 cyl models may have been possible.With 14 different color possibilities, any existing one is very rare. I have a hatchback one in mahogany(rootbeer color)..but its in very poor shape..I hope to find another car that can donate its parts to rebuild this one......someday..<BR>
 <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>1977... <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>This is the year that the bold graphics package (Z02)became available.All i know about this year is that 7089 were built..A small number of these may have been "Z01 only" cars. Even though coupes were made as spyders last year,and the sport front clip like on the 2+2s was available,there were none made.The Standard catalog of Chevrolet also says the package was only available on the sport hatchbacks,as does the dealer literature. Any available motor tranny combo was possible though. Would you have bought a 4cyl spyder???:-)  75-76-77 monzas were made at the ST.Therese Canada plant. Also 77 was the last year for an orange spyder.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>1978....<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>This year monza production moved to Lordstown Ohio.(some were made at a southgate california plant but im not sure what year or if spyders were made there). At Lordstown,some nice things got done..first "build sheets"were typically left under the carpet,behind door panels and behind the plastic seat backs of cloth seat equipped cars. second.the "body plate"also known as a "trim tag" located on the cowl area next to the drivers side hood hinge in the engine compt.,was a little more detailed.both of these items can help document a "factory" spyder.<BR>
The build sheet will have the Z01 and most likelyZ02 options listed in the last column of options.If it was so equipped.<BR>
 On the "trim tag"I have also noticed a".  .    .02"on the third line down on my graphic equipped cars (Z02). it actually says 02blk which I presume is for the stripe color because a gold striped 78 I have seen says 02gld. Please E-MAIL me with what your spyder body plate says so we can really figure out the markings. thanks  ..SO.. getting back to 78..  6,391 spyders with the Z01 AND Z02 packages were produced..another 990 were made with the Z01 only package. bringing the total to 7,381 spyders for 1978. This was available with any motor and any color. Many were probably V6s with the 4 and the 8cyl s being the most rare. 9478 8cyl models were made and many of these were just plain 2+2 models.Again,all literature states that all spyders were hatchbacks. No round headlight models were spyders. The rarest color for 1978 was medium green#44..with only 4728 being made.<BR>
The most popular color was light blue#22..16,757.<BR>
I can tell you any 78 color total if you email me.I got the #s from 1-800-222-1020..Chevys customer service hotline.<BR>
  <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B><I>the Z02 package..<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B></I> for 77 to79 the colors for the door stripe were either black or gold.With the black stripes the fancy spyder lettering in it would have been either Red ,Gold or<BR>
 White. Gold stripes always had white lettering.the hood ,and spoiler decal also folow these color patterns.The stripes were all applied by hand in a special part of the factory as far as i know. <BR>
 In 1979 they also added blue and green to the spyder outline lettering with the black stripes.<BR>
  I have listings of what color would have come with what stripe for 77-79 if your interested.Also, all window moldings were semigloss black(except on black cars which had regular chrome) and spyder emblems were on the front,back,and steering wheel. Some spyders may have had the spoilers deleted at the customers request ,but for the most part they all had them at the front and rear.Also,Some spyders but not all ,came with a spyder decal,similar to the hood decal ,across the black dash trim plate above the glove box door,if the dash clock was not ordered. I have seen this mostly in 77 cars.I dont know why some would have been missing this or if it was eventually cancelled or something.<BR>
  Spyders with the V8 option also had dual exhaust Outlets ,one poking out just under each rear corner.In 1976/77 car magazines where the spyder was tested,you may notice that the exhaust 2 outlets poked straigt out the back through 2 cutouts on the lower rear urethane facia.As far as i know this only was on the car pictured in the magazine.(a yellow one).Let me know if you've ever seen this anywhere else!<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B> 1979...<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B> 8,670 Z01 and Z02 cars were produced. Another 1,009 cars had only the Z01 pkg. Only 8,180 had a V8 engine too.Apparently the 100,000,000th chevy was a monza produced this year.Anyone have any info on this??? Also..the spyder model"trim tags" which said. . .02blk or 02gld now only seemed to say... 02. they also no longer included the last 8 digits of the vin.<BR>
 <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>1980... <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>This year the package was heavily revised..the hood decal was a bit different and the side stripes were completely different,being much larger and always correspondind to the cars interior color. <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B> <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>There was only one combination spyder package offered.<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B> <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>7,589 of these were made. All had a V6 or 4cyl.                                                     <BR>
       <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=7><B> <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5>NOTE <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>this info may or may not be correct,but its as I understand it at this time.Hope you enjoyed it.Currently,to increase my knowledge on the production of these cars I am interested in obtaining the info from Any 1978 Monza,Sunbird,Starfire,Skyhawk model. If you can or are willing to offer the info please e-mail me..Send me all the stamped in #s off of the trim tag.+ also the build date in the upper left hand corner of the "buildsheet" if you have found this to. <BR>
Thanks in advance for anything you can offer:-)</P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><P> <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/KLEENKARS/MIRAGE.html">KLEEN KAR'S R US!</A> <BR>
