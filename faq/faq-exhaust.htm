I have used two different makes of headers and the factory manifolds. &nbsp; The factory manifolds don't make as much power, but they are very reliable and trouble free. &nbsp; The pictures show what the right (passenger's side) manifold <B>(GM part no.: 354432)</B> looks like, it fits <B>A, B, and X bodies</B> as well. &nbsp; It is recessed slightly between the #6 and #8 exhaust ports to clear the upper control-arm tower in the engine compartment. &nbsp; This recess is slightly noticeable in the lower right photo, just to the left of the "Factory RH Ehaust Manifold" label and is where the part number is found. &nbsp; The left (driver's side) manifold <B>(GM part no.: 354433)</B> (next picture) is routed above the exhaust outlets (similar to some F-bodys and Monte Carlos) then drops down to the collector between the #5&7 outlets. &nbsp; <B>Contrary to popular belief, these manifolds are not limited to the V8 Monza only, they can also be found on 262 c.i. equipped '75 Novas as well.</B> Don't get ripped off buying manifolds made for another vehicle because chances are they won't work. &nbsp; I still have mine in case I get tired of the headers.

Most V8 H-body headers you will find are advertised to fit the Vega or Monza, but they will fit all H-bodies. &nbsp; However, some headers <B>"REQUIRE"</B> a V8 mount kit because the header tubes run in the areas where the Monza factory V8 mounts are located. &nbsp; This does not mean that you can't use Monza motor mounts, It just means that you may have difficulty using them and should use their kit. &nbsp; Of course headers are like all other aftermarket equipment, they usually have to be dented here or there to fit just right. &nbsp; The headers do make a lot more power, but they can rub the steering column and other things and may leak so badly that they burn plug wires, gaskets, etc.. &nbsp; Most of my header problems stem from the fact that I have oversized exhaust ports and I'm too miserly to pop for the $799 racing headers and instead use the street versions.

I used these once before and to some degree am sorry I got rid of them. &nbsp; I used them with the factory V8 mounts. &nbsp; They cleared the mounts and steering column better than the Hedman's do. &nbsp; I only got rid of them because I ported the exhaust ports on my heads so big that they leaked past the sealing bead on the headers. &nbsp; The Hedmans leak with the oversized ports too, but not as bad. &nbsp;  Also the collectors aimed outward on both sides so that the exhaust tubes that I connected to the collector flanges had to be bent in a J-shape to try to get the exhaust back under the car and they were still very visible from the side of the car. &nbsp; They're probably great for racing but many people including myself don't like the looks of them.

<BR><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:16pt;"><U>Small-Block Chevy (262 - 400)</U></B></FONT>

<BR><FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Hooker Chevy small-block headers were available as P/N (part number) 2129 and P/N 2135 (for use with factory motor mounts) for small-block Chevy engines. &nbsp; Hooker's small-block V8 Vega headers are very similar to the Hedman Vega headers and as such probably won't work with A/C or power steering and won't fit factory installed V8 cars. &nbsp; That is, the factory V8 engine mounts will interfer with the headers fit. &nbsp; One tube on each side requires a hole cut into the fenderwell just above the brake-line so the tube can exit the engine compartment, turn down following the back of the fenderwell, turn back under and join the rest of the tubes at the collectors under the car.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Hooker has two different small-block kits, one fits the factory V8 Monza and clears the engine mounts. &nbsp; The other set (V8 Vega) doesn't work with the factory engine mounts and should only be used with the Hooker small-block engine mount kit P/N 12601 ('71-'74 cars) or P/N 12608 ('75-'80 cars). &nbsp; By the way, the Hooker mount kit looks exactly like the Hedman, Motion Performance and Trans-Dapt kits. &nbsp; So if you can't find the kit through one try the others.

<FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE:12pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Hooker Chevy big-block headers were available as P/N 2240. &nbsp; Hooker's big-block V8 Vega headers are very hard to find today. &nbsp; They won't work with A/C, power brakes, or power steering and require a remote oil filter conversion. &nbsp; You will also have to modify the steering column by cutting it in a couple places and installing unversal joints (swivel links) so that the steering column may be rerouted around the left header.  For those who don't like the idea of cutting their steering column, you can install a Mustang II type rack-and-pinion steering gear box.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Hooker also has a big-block installation kit P/N 12603. &nbsp;

The Hedmans were available in two part numbers, 68330 and 68340. &nbsp; I don't have any information about P/N 68330 at this time. &nbsp; However, according to Hedman, P/N 68340 won't work with A/C or power steering and won't fit factory V8 cars. &nbsp; One tube on each side requires a hole cut into the fenderwell just above the brake-line so the tube can exit the engine compartment, turn down following the back of the fenderwell, turn back under and join the rest of the tubes at the collectors under the car.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm using P/N 68340 with the Monza factory engine mounts and believe me, the headers really have to be bent a lot to clear the RH motor mount. &nbsp; If you plan on using a mechanical fuel pump the headers will require even more denting as they become sandwiched between the RH motor mount and the fuel pump. &nbsp; This really chokes the flow of the #2 tube. &nbsp; These headers are so much like the Hooker V8 Vega headers that they are really hard to tell apart.

As you can see by the photos, these headers are going to be fun to install (sarcasm). &nbsp; Also, it looks to me as though sparkplug changes would be an activity best left to contortionists. &nbsp; I've heard they are still available but it takes several weeks to get them as they are made only when they are ordered and are VERY expensive.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>To the right is a picture of the "REAL" Sanderson V8 H-Body shorty headers, part number CC13</B>. &nbsp; They have 1  1/2" tubes and 2 1/2" collectors.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the lower-right is a picture from an ad Sanderson placed in the June 1999 issue of SUPER CHEVY magazine.  As I stated from the start, I didn't see how the headers in the ad could ever fit V8 H-Bodies.  The headers in the ad were incorrectly described as being for a V8 Vega or Monza and even a Nova.  As it turns out, they only fit the Nova. &nbsp; Below, Jeff and Aaron describe the correct Sanderson header that I believe may be just what many people want in a shorty header. &nbsp; So, Sanderson makes an excellent shorty header for the V8 H-Body, they just don't have a good advertising department. &nbsp; Read on for the whole story.

<P>
Jeff & Aaron sent me this e-mail:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM><I>
Sanderson headers are a shorty type header with 1.5" tubes, these are not equal length but they do fit into the engine compartment rather well. &nbsp; I only had to ding one tube for spark plug clearance (the third back from the front on the drivers side) but if you are using angle plug heads even this is not necessary. &nbsp; The steering column has to be removed to install the driver side header but the engine can be bolted in. &nbsp; They are a barely proposition to get in on the drivers side but once in everything lines up it all fits with clearance (better than any header V/8 or otherwise that I have ever installed) to spare around the column. &nbsp; The passenger side header almost drops right into place and fits without rubbing or interfering with anything. &nbsp; On the steering column, if your car has power steering and /or a tilt column the shaft is a two piece affair that can be removed and reassembled rather easily but if you have a non power non tilt column it is a one piece arrangement that requires the complete removal of the column. &nbsp; Getting the one piece column back in requires disassembling the joint at the end to allow it to pass through the header. &nbsp; An easier solution is to procure a two piece column or use this as a good excuse to install a tilt column (we did). &nbsp; Also remember when you take a steering column lower joint apart to mark what way it was assembled or you will have your steering wheel 1/2 turn out of whack and your turn signals won't cancel properly (voice of experience talking there). &nbsp; We have installed three sets of these headers. &nbsp; One set in a car where the engine was already a running unit with the aforementioned one piece column and the job was completed in a friend's driveway in one evening without any specialized tools. &nbsp; Exhaust was done at a local exhaust shop for about $130 but we had bought the mufflers elsewhere as the shop did not carry the ones that we wanted.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
These headers dump in approximately the same places as stock monza V/8 manifolds but I doubt they would mate up to the factory Y pipe without considerable modification. &nbsp; These headers are not for the really serious racer but are ideal for the fast street driver who does not want to drag off the bottom side of his expensive exhaust system. &nbsp; Those Hooker headers that go under the car require lots of extra ground clearance and in Colorado you have to have 4" ground clearance to be legal. &nbsp; On a Vega or Monza this requires jacking the suspension nearly to the top. &nbsp; With our interest in road racing this is not feasible but we are not legal anyway as we have been running closer to 3". &nbsp; Thankfully the CHP does not seem to care as long as it is within reason.</font>

These shorty headers, <B>P/N</B> (part number) <B>CC13</B>, are for V8 H-Bodies (Monza, Vega, and Clones) and they fit straight or angle plug heads. &nbsp; Based on this photo and compared to my own factory manifolds and the space available in the engine compartment, they are sure to be easier than any other header to install as they look <B><U>bolt-in</U></B>. &nbsp; However, as Jeff and Aaron state they require removal of the steering column and may need the #3 tube slightly dented to clear the #3 sparkplug, but they are as close to bolt-in as you can get. &nbsp; Also, they will not bolt up to the factory cross-over pipe. &nbsp; They're listed as $219 for plain and $359 for the JET-HOT coated.

These headers were incorrectly advertised to fit the small-block Chevy V8 equipped H-Body. &nbsp; These headers do not fit the H-Body, they are for the Chevy Nova. &nbsp; Sanderson's ad in Super Chevy magazine (June 1999), stated that <B>P/N</B> (part number) <B>CC14</B>, are for V8 Monzas and Vegas and they fit straight or angle plug heads. &nbsp; Based on the photo Sanderson has supplied and compared to my own factory manifolds and the space available in the engine compartment, they are sure to be a disappointment as they look <B><U>anything but bolt-in</U></B>. &nbsp; See Sanderson headers P/N CC13 (shown above this picture) for the correct headers.

Below are some pictures of the Sanderson headers (P/N CC13) installed. &nbsp; According to Jeff and Aaron, these headers dump in exactly the same location as the factory V8 manifolds. &nbsp; Anyone that uses these, please give me the scoop on sparkplug changes, it looks like it would be a real pain. &nbsp; More information is available at <A HREF="http://www.centuryperformance.com/sanderson20.htm#CC13" TARGET="newwindow">http://www.centuryperformance.com/sanderson20.htm#CC13</A>, look for P/N CC13.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this picture, you can clearly see that the steering column goes through the headers.  This is why the column must be removed first before the driver's side header can be installed.  Also notice that they don't leave much room to maneuver around during sparkplug changes.

Here you can see that the passenger's side header drops right in with little problem. &nbsp; Why the owner of the vehicle dented the #6 tube is a mystery to me, maybe he will write and tell us.
