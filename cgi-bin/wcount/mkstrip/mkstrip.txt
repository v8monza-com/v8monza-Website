NAME
       mkstrip - makes a strip of image by concatenating several
       GIF images.

SYPONSIS
       mkstrip file1.gif file2.gif file3.gif .... > final.gif

DESCRIPTION
       mkstrip is a program to create a single GIF image by
       concatenating several GIF images. It writes the
       concatenated image on stdout. The images can be of any
       size.

       This program can be used to concatenate arbitrary GIF
       images, but this program must be used to create digit
       image strip for the WWW Homepage access counter, because
       it keeps necessary information about the strip in the GIF
       comment extension.

EXAMPLES
           mkstrip image1.gif image2.gif image3.gif > final.gif

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
       Thanks to John Cristy for ImageMagick. I borrowed many
       routines from ImageMagick in GIF image combining library.
