##-- options section
; If auto_file_creation=Yes, then the users can create data files. It IS
;  dangerous to set this option to Yes.
#
; strict_mode=Yes or No. Run the program in strict mode or not. It's a good
;  idea to set this option to Yes. Otherwise anyone will be able to run your
;  counter remotely.
#
; allow_rgb_database=Yes or No. Convenient to use because colorname e.g., red,
;  gold etc can be used instead of rgb components of the color, however it is
;  very inefficient to lookup. If your site is busy, set this option to No.
#
; count_reload=Yes or No. It is a good idea to set this option to No. But
;  you've to set this option to Yes if you are running a proxy server or 
;  like to count browser reload. Normally set this to No.
#
; log_error_messages=Yes or No. If your site is extremely busy and if the
;  coutner generates lots of logs, set this option to No. Normally set this
;  option to Yes.
#
; show_error_messages_to_browsers=Yes or No. Set this option to No if you are
;  concerned with privacy and you're sure that the counter works perfectly.
;  If you set this option to No, counter will not send error or warning
;  messages to the browsers. Normally set this option to Yes.
