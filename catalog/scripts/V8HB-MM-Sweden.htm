These motor mounts have been specially designed and hand-made by Bob Gumm to replace your factory V8 mounts. &nbsp; Factory mounts are no longer available and even if you can find them you'll pay over $200.00 for them. &nbsp; Our mounts were designed using factory mounts as a template and with future replacement costs in mind. &nbsp; After just a few months original mounts begin to sag, but not our mounts. &nbsp; Our mounts are designed using an off-the-shelf mount that by design resists sagging. &nbsp; When these mounts finally do need replacement, you can pick up a replacement mount at your local parts store for about $10 or less. &nbsp; Take a look at this <A HREF="http://www.v8monza.com/catalog/images/replacement_v8_mounts-005b.jpg" TARGET="newwindow">photo</A> of our mounts. &nbsp; Remember, because these mounts maintain their original form they'll give you back the clearance between your oil pan and K-frame/steering components. &nbsp; Some customers have reported reduced clearance between the engine and hood with these mounts. &nbsp; Not that our mounts are taller, it's just that the original mounts sag so badly that the engine eventually sat lower. &nbsp; Some folks who had the old sagging mounts had installed performance induction systems that just cleared the hood. &nbsp; Our mounts bring the engine back up to where it should be and as a result there is less clearance between some induction systems and the hood. &nbsp; <B>These mounts are available for immediate shipment.</B>
