Replacement V8 Motor Mounts: &nbsp;</B></FONT>
These motor mounts have been specially designed and hand-made by Bob Gumm to replace your factory V8 mounts. &nbsp; Factory mounts are no longer available and even if you can find them you'll pay over $200.00 for them. &nbsp; Our mounts were designed using factory mounts as a template and with future replacement costs in mind. &nbsp; After just a few months original mounts begin to sag, but not our mounts. &nbsp; Our mounts are designed using an off-the-shelf mount that by design resists sagging. &nbsp; When these mounts finally do need replacement, you can pick up a replacement mount at your local parts store for about $10 or less. &nbsp; Take a look at this <A HREF="http://www.v8monza.com/catalog/images/replacement_v8_mounts-005b.jpg" TARGET="newwindow">photo</A> of our mounts. &nbsp; Remember, because these mounts maintain their original form they'll give you back the clearance between your oil pan and K-frame/steering components. &nbsp; Some customers have reported reduced clearance between the engine and hood with these mounts. &nbsp; Not that our mounts are taller, it's just that the original mounts sag so badly that the engine eventually sat lower. &nbsp; Some folks who had the old sagging mounts had installed performance induction systems that just cleared the hood. &nbsp; Our mounts bring the engine back up to where it should be and as a result there is less clearance between some induction systems and the hood. &nbsp; <B>These mounts are available for immediate shipment.</B>

Ball Joint Adapter Kit: &nbsp;</B></FONT>
<B>Adapt Chevy S10 or G-Body 5-lug front brakes (spindles, calipers and rotors) to your H-Body using these adapters.</B> &nbsp; Better braking and wider choice of wheels are just two of the benefits you'll enjoy when you upgrade to the larger brakes this kit makes possible. &nbsp; For more information, go to our <B><A HREF="http://www.v8monza.com/faq-fsus-S10_front-walk-thru.htm" TARGET="newwindow">step-by-step guide</A></B> on how to make this simple and effective upgrade. &nbsp; Remember, other adapters just don't measure up, these adapters have been made for H-Bodies only and have gone through rigorous testing to ensure a high-quality product with no surprises. &nbsp; <B>The larger 1975-1980 H-Body lower balljoints must be used with these adapters. &nbsp; 1974 and earlier balljoints are smaller and will need to be changed.</B> &nbsp; Pictorial instructions also included.</FONT>
