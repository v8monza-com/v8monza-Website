      style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">These motor mounts have been specially designed 
      and hand-made by Bob Gumm to replace your factory V8 mounts. &nbsp; 
      Factory mounts are no longer available and even if you can find them 
      you'll pay over $200.00 for them. &nbsp; Our mounts were designed using 
      factory mounts as a template and with future replacement costs in mind. 
      &nbsp; After just a few months original mounts begin to sag, but not our 
      mounts. &nbsp; Our mounts are designed using an off-the-shelf mount that 
      by design resists sagging. &nbsp; When these mounts finally do need 
      replacement, you can pick up a replacement mount at your local parts store 
      for about $10 or less. &nbsp; Take a look at this <A 
      href="V8HB-MM2-Sweden_files/replacement_v8_mounts-005b.jpg" 
      target=newwindow>photo</A> of our mounts. &nbsp; Remember, because these 
      mounts maintain their original form they'll give you back the clearance 
      between your oil pan and K-frame/steering components. &nbsp; Some 
      customers have reported reduced clearance between the engine and hood with 
      these mounts. &nbsp; Not that our mounts are taller, it's just that the 
      original mounts sag so badly that the engine eventually sat lower. &nbsp; 
      Some folks who had the old sagging mounts had installed performance 
      induction systems that just cleared the hood. &nbsp; Our mounts bring the 
      engine back up to where it should be and as a result there is less 
      clearance between some induction systems and the hood. &nbsp; <B>These 
      mounts are available for immediate shipment.</B> </FONT>
