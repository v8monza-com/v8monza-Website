<P>
Sorry, no CODs or personal checks.  Please do not send cash through the mail.

Sorry, we are not set up to take orders by phone.  We do offer 2 ways to order, 
<P>
1. To use PayPal, go to our <A href="http://www.v8monza.com/catalog/index.htm" TARGET="newwindow">Online Catalog</A>.  Selected items have PayPal buttons for quick ordering.  Other items can be ordered using PayPal, but we need to be contacted with your zip code first, as these are shipped via UPS.
<BR>NOTE: Make sure your browser's cookies are turned on, PayPal payments will not work with the cookies turned off.  If you have other problems using PayPal, please contact <A href="http://www.paypal.com/help" TARGET="newwindow">PayPal's help</A>.

2. For "Snail" Mail Orders (w/ money order), click the hypertext "Click here for order form to buy via snail mail" under the product in the <A href="http://www.v8monza.com/catalog/index.htm" TARGET="newwindow">Online Catalog</A>.  From there you can print out an order form to order with a USPS money order. <font color=#FF0000><B>NOTE: Due to occurrences of attempts to pass off stolen money orders, we are instituting a wait period of 10-14 days on all non Postal Service money orders.

The fastest way for orders to be shipped is still by using PayPal, followed by USPS (or Canadian) money orders.
